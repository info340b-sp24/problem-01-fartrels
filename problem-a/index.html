        . In this story he and other high school soccer players are locked in a facility created by the Japan National Football Team that aims to develop the ultimate striker in order to win the World Cup. There, Isagi learns what it means to be a true striker and realizes his special abilities that aid him on the football pitch to score goals.

        <li>His eyes</li>
            <ul>When Isagi's powers awaken his eyes start glowing a blue color and it looks so awesome (as seen above). I wish my eyes could do that.</ul>
